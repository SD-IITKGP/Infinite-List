# Infinite-List
Infinite List Created using React.js.
For logging in use username:"foo" and password:"bar". To get the list keep scrolling to load more and more data.

Used two methods to implement, one using npm module and one is comment below which is custom code. Both codes works fine.

The data has been extracted with API using ajax method of jQuery, but later used stored it as the API has limited number of time till which we can request data.
